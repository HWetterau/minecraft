Extra Credits:
We draw a procedurally-generated sky
We added sand and water cubes - to see the water cubes you have to go under the water plane
Press n to start the day/night cycle, it takes under a minute to go through the entire cycle
so there's not a button to speed it up. The moon moves along the z axis as the cycle goes.
