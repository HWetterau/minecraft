Extra Credits:
constant sized wireframe (done in ocean and floor fragment shaders)
light source represented by a sphere - we loaded in an obj file
created a skybox - files are in the assets folder, we use stb_image.h to load in
                  the images
we added bobbing viking boats - activate the boats by pressing b when ocean is on.
  They look glitchy from far away, but close up is fine. It's the same thing that
  happens to the menger sponge.
